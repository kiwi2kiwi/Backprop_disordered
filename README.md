# Backprop_disordered
Deep feedforward neural network without layer structure\
Since layer structure is broken i name this BrokeNN.\
Runs on the Iris dataset, MNIST, and the example on https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/ .\
Practical application of Backpropagation_diy project.


Only fancy libraries needed are numpy for array convenience, sklearn for dataset, matplotlib for visualization
This was not done to create a new fancy advanced network. It's just a funny lil project.
