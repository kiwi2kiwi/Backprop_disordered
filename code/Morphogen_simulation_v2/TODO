calculate the morpho conc from other cells - done

read the input size and create the first few cells - done
read the output size and create the last few cells - done

create a format that the neural network can read and convert into an architecture
- neurons import - done
- axons import - done
- add axons to neurons - done
- connect neurons - done

Demo axon creation from first input to first output cell
- Currently the connect rule connects every cell that receives enough of morphogen a to every cell that expresses morphogen a
- make it that there is a condition morphogen and a target morphogen  - DONE
- make the demo axon - done

Run NN on architecture - done




TODO
test the morphogens - done
why do cells connect to first out? - done
output neurons should not execute morphogenesis rules - done

- create custom rule for debugging that fully connects input and output for the iris dataset task - done
- maby there's a bug in my evaluation or error feedback function - done
- metrics return error because output is messy - done
- create population - done
- individuals return performance as fitness score - done
- mutate the individuals - done
- add the morpho rules from the previous generation to the next one - done
- Problem: not only the rules are needed to build, but also the morphogens (i think, it should be checked!!!!!!!) - done, only rules are needed
- move the dataset initialization and loading to the population class - done
- prevent connections to input neurons - done
- got a loop in the network and i need to fix that asap - done
    - backprop number for each child neuron that limits the recursion loops - done
    - reset the counter in the reset neuron function
    - somewhere lots of neurons and axons get generated and i don't know where or why
    - create verbal output of rule_type 3 and which rule executed it
    - also verbal for rule_type 4
    - dont import cells and connections to the final nn that are not connected to the input - done
- do morphogenesis multiple times, so iterative rules can be done multiple times - done
- prevent cell from overlapping by blocking new cell from spawning if within distance - TODO
- allow output node bias maby - TODO
- import and export morphogen rules to a file - TODO
- maby test out GA by only evolution, no training - TODO

- make morphogen concentration falloff calculation available to GA
- create the ability for multiple conditions, so that we get activators and repressors



Morphogen Rule conditionals like transcription factor binding sites
    refine them biologically ----------
    what they do




project schedule
network cancer
allowing different architectures to grow like rnns
