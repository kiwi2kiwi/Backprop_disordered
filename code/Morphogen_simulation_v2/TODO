calculate the morpho conc from other cells - done

read the input size and create the first few cells - done
read the output size and create the last few cells - done

create a format that the neural network can read and convert into an architecture
- neurons import - done
- axons import - done
- add axons to neurons - done
- connect neurons - done

Demo axon creation from first input to first output cell
- Currently the connect rule connects every cell that receives enough of morphogen a to every cell that expresses morphogen a
- make it that there is a condition morphogen and a target morphogen  - DONE
- make the demo axon - done

Run NN on architecture


Morphogen Rule conditionals like transcription factor binding sites


TODO
test the morphogens - done
why do cells connect to first out? - done
output neurons should not execute morphogenesis rules - done
move the dataset initialization and loading to the population class

refine them biologically ----------
what they do




project schedule
network cancer
allowing different architectures to grow like rnns
