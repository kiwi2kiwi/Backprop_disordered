calculate the morpho conc from other cells - done

read the input size and create the first few cells - done
read the output size and create the last few cells - done

create a format that the neural network can read and convert into an architecture
- neurons import - done
- axons import - done
- add axons to neurons - done
- connect neurons - done

Demo axon creation from first input to first output cell
- Currently the connect rule connects every cell that receives enough of morphogen a to every cell that expresses morphogen a
- make it that there is a condition morphogen and a target morphogen  - DONE
- make the demo axon - done

Run NN on architecture - done




TODO
test the morphogens - done
why do cells connect to first out? - done
output neurons should not execute morphogenesis rules - done

- create custom rule for debugging that fully connects input and output for the iris dataset task - done
- maby there's a bug in my evaluation or error feedback function - done
- metrics return error because output is messy - done
- create population - done
- individuals return performance as fitness score - done
- mutate the individuals - done
- add the morpho rules from the previous generation to the next one -------------- working on this
- Problem: not only the rules are needed to build, but also the morphogens (i think, it should be checked!!!!!!!)
- allow output node bias maby
- import and export morphogen rules to a file
- maby test out GA by only evolution, no training


move the dataset initialization and loading to the population class

Morphogen Rule conditionals like transcription factor binding sites
    refine them biologically ----------
    what they do




project schedule
network cancer
allowing different architectures to grow like rnns
